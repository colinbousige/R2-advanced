# Create a 3 column `tibble` called `df` containing three columns `x`, `y` and `z` with:

# - `x` a vector from -pi to pi of length 10
# - `y` the sinus of `x`
# - and `z` the sum of the two first columns.

df <- tibble(
        x = seq(-pi,pi, length=10),# you define the column x
        y = sin(x),# you define the column y by referring tho the column x previously defined
        z = x+y)   # you define the column z by referring tho the columns x and y previously defined

                       # the vector x that was created outside the call to data.frame
           z = x*y) # here to define the column z you refer to the vectors

# Print the 4 first lines of the table df.
# Hint: Take a look at the head() function
df %>% head(4)

# Print the second (*i.e.* `y`) column with 7 different methods.
# Hint: Take a look at the `$` operator, the `[[` operator, the `select()` function, and the `pull()` function.

# Hint: Take a look at the `$` operator and the `mutate()` function.
df$z <- df$z - min(df$z)
df <- df %>% mutate(z = z - min(z))

# Print the average of the `z` column.

# Look into the function `write_csv()` to write a text file containing this `tibble`. Compare it to the `write.csv()` function.

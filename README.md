## Program

- Tidy data: definition and use
- The pipe, your new friend
- Data manipulation with `dplyr`: filtering, arranging, selecting, mutating, grouping and summarising your data
- Importing and exporting data with `readr`.
- Joining data with `dplyr`: `inner_join()`, `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `full_join()`, `semi_join()`, and `anti_join()`.
- String manipulation with `stringr`.
- Managing date and time with `lubridate`.
- Functional programming with `purrr`
- Visualising data with `ggplot2`.

## Prerequisites

Have a basic level of R: know how to read and manipulate data, use Rstudio. Bring your own computer (any OS) with administrator rights. No specific scientific field is expected: what is covered in this course is suitable for all fields. Participants are encouraged to bring their own data for more interactive exercises tailored to their needs.

## Type of intervention

Lectures and practical work. [The course content is online](https://colinbousige.github.io/rclass/).

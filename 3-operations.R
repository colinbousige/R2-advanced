## Exercise 3
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# Here we will see how to load many files at once with the `tidyverse` and how to perform some data wrangling.

### Loading the data

# We will work with the files whose paths are stored in the vector `flist`. These files are all `.csv` files containing two columns and a header.

# !!!! We can use the fact that `read_csv()` accepts vectors as argument and read them all at once.

# - Using list.files(), find all the files in the "Data" folder that have the "sampleX_tempK_time-UNIT.csv" pattern.
# - Read them all in a tidy tibble called `tib`.
# - Make sure to add a column named `"file"` containing the list of filenames: look at the `id` parameter
# - Modify this `"file"` column so that it contains just the file name and not the full path â€“ look at the `basename()` function.

flist <- list.files(____)

tib <- read_csv(___,           # what do we want to read? give the vector of file names
                id = ___) |>  # what is the name of the column containing the file names ?
        mutate(___)            # modify this column so that it contains just the file
                               # name and not the full path


### Operations on strings

# We also want to get information from our file names, such as the sample number, the temperature, the time, and the time unit.
# Use the function [`separate()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html) to split the `file` column into `sample`, `T`, `time` and `time_unit`.
# If applicable, make sure that the resulting columns are numeric by getting rid of the annoying characters.
# Look into the `stringr` cheat sheet for help: https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/strings.pdf

tib <- tib |>
    separate(col = ___, # what is the column containing these informations
             into = ___, # vector of strings containing new column names (NA to drop a column)
             convert = ___) |> # do we convert strings to numbers if applicable?
    mutate(sample = ___,
           T = ___,
           time_unit = ___,
           time = ___
           )
tib

# Now we want all times to be in the same unit. Using `mutate()` and `ifelse()`, convert the minutes in seconds, then get rid of the `time_unit` column.

tib <- tib |>
    mutate(time = ifelse(test, yes, no)) |> # convert minutes to seconds
    select(___) # get rid of the `time_unit` column
tib
